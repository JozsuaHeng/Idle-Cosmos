# Idle Cosmos (token-universe)

A local web app that turns Claude Code token usage into ONE slowly-built
pixel model of the real known universe. Every session's tokens pool into
"cosmic energy" (`ENERGY_PER_BLOCK` in `public/app.js`, three selectable
paces — Patient/Steady/Eager); blocks assemble the Sun and planets
core-outward with real geological layers, then belts, named stars, deep-sky
objects (nebulae, galaxies, black holes, the CMB), all the way out to the
Laniakea Supercluster. Once everything unlockable is fully built, the
universe can "cool" and a new cycle begins from a new seed (`beginNewCycle`)
— meta-progress (the achievement book, lifetime totals) carries over.

## How it works

- `server.js` — zero-dependency Node server on `http://localhost:4816`. It
  **reads** (never writes) Claude Code's own session logs in
  `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, tallies token usage per session, and
  streams live updates over Server-Sent Events. No API keys, no outbound
  network calls, nothing leaves the machine. Also serves `/api/config`
  (the real token→energy weights, so the client never hand-duplicates them)
  and `/api/version` (lets an already-open tab detect file changes and
  auto-reload instead of running stale code indefinitely).
- `public/` — the universe page. Canvas-based, fully deterministic: a fixed
  base seed (XORed with the cycle number) drives every RNG call, so the
  same cycle always rebuilds pixel-identical. Camera framing
  (`visibleRect`, `flyToCentered`, `fitCompleted`) measures the *actual*
  current window/panel state rather than fixed pixel guesses, and re-fits
  on resize — this was a real bug once (see git log), not a hypothetical.
- `hooks/open-universe.sh` — a Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook that
  starts the server if needed and opens the page only if no tab is already
  connected. Installed in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-level).
- `baseline.json` — **machine-local, gitignored, never commit it.** Written
  once, the very first time `server.js` ever runs on a given machine: it
  freezes whatever token energy already existed in that machine's Claude
  Code logs as `baselineEnergy`. `targetBlocks()` only counts energy earned
  *after* that point (see `ensureBaseline()` in server.js and `baselineEnergy`
  in app.js). Without this, cloning the repo onto a machine with a long
  Claude Code history would instantly unlock most of the universe instead of
  starting at zero. If you ever need to reset a dev machine to "fresh
  install" behaviour, delete `baseline.json` and restart the server.

## Notable systems

- **Pace** (`PACES`): Patient/Steady/Eager just change `ENERGY_PER_BLOCK`;
  switching is lossless since everything derives from real token totals.
- **Achievement book** (`PHENOMENA`, `witnessPhenomenon`): rare ambient sky
  events (supernova, black hole, quasar, GRB, kilonova, rogue planet,
  meteoroid collision, nova, pulsar flash, tidal disruption, auroral storm,
  comet outburst, the "twin streak" rarity, and cycle completion) are
  silently recorded to `localStorage` on first sighting. The book UI
  (📖 button) never lists undiscovered entries — by design, don't add a
  "here's everything you can find" list. Each recorded entry (except
  `reborn`, which has no standalone visual) has a "watch again" button
  (`replayPhenomenon`) that replays its exact animation on demand, for
  events missed while the tab sat idle — it never re-adds an entry or
  changes the recorded date, since `witnessPhenomenon` already dedupes by id.
  `spawnBigPhenomenon` takes an optional `forceKind` and `spawnTwinStreak`
  is its own function specifically so replay can call the same code path
  as the real, random spawn. Rarity (`spawnAmbient`'s roll thresholds) is
  deliberately low — these are meant to be rare enough that "watch again"
  is genuinely useful, not just a novelty.
- **Personalization**: an optional name composes into the title everywhere
  via `composedTitle()` — never hardcode "Idle Cosmos" elsewhere; call that
  function instead so cycle number / owner name stay in sync.
- **Ornaments** (`drawOrnaments`): real spacecraft/rovers per body (Ingenuity
  at Mars, Voyager 2 at Uranus+Neptune, Cassini's Grand Finale at Saturn,
  etc.), plus one deliberate non-real one (a UFO at Earth).

## Design constraints

- Zero npm dependencies; only Node built-ins.
- Keep CPU/GPU use light: the placed-block grid renders once to an offscreen
  canvas, only twinklers/ambient events/ornaments animate per frame, the
  loop idles when the tab is hidden, and it respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Background specks (`drawSpecks`) are procedural/infinite via a hash
  function, not a fixed pre-seeded array — needed so they're still visible
  at extreme zoom-out (down to 0.3%) instead of only existing within the
  built world's fixed bounds.
- Mobile: sidebar starts collapsed under 700px width; see the `@media`
  block in `style.css` for panel-overlap fixes specific to narrow screens.

## Running manually

```
node server.js         # then visit http://localhost:4816
```
